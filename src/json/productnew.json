Infused with Colloidal Sulfur and Bentonite Clay, the formula detoxifies the skin’s surface to remove dirt, impurities, dead cells and pimple-causing bacteria from the pores. Also enriched with exfoliating Kaolin Clay, the mask helps to balance the skin’s oil levels, combatting excess sebum production to mattify the surface. Despite its purifying powers, the mask is non-drying. Packed with skin-friendly ingredients, the mask leaves the visage moisturised and nourished, rather than dry or tight. What’s more, Phenylethyl Resorcinol and Zinc Oxide work in harmony to reduce any redness and cool any irritation, with an anti-inflammatory effect that leaves skin with a more even tone and texture. Finally, Aloe Vera Extract helps to heal and repair the skin, reducing the appearance of acne scars and imperfection. Multi-talented, the mask can be used as a spot treatment or an overnight mask, working to reveal more balanced complexion.",

This product uses next-generation retinoid active technologies which have been shown to achieve better reduction in signs of aging than retinol without irritation. These technologies cannot be compared directly with retinol itself in terms of concentration because they include a different retinoid molecule, in a similar way that Retinol cannot be compared with Retinoic Acid in terms of concentration.",

This larger size allows mandelic acid to penetrate the skin more slowly which in turn makes it very gentle and suitable for all skin types. You don't need a concentration of more than 10%, because then you would simply be achieving an indirect peeling strength that is more easily offered through lower percentages of glycolic acid. Note: While exfoliating acids can result in quick visible benefits, we  suggest the use of indirect forms of skin exfoliation in favour of direct forms such as this formula due to potential inflammation and sensitivity associated with acids.
